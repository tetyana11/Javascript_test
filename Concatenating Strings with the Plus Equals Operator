/*Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. */


// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. "; 
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
